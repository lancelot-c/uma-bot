The file editor opens. By default all disputes have a `P0` answer, replace it with the answer you think is the correct one:
```
{
    "ancillaryData": "0x616e63696c6c61727944617461486173683a363466383561343338306639613061353934316164303733376264616538633037643964333036353039653763373264303966313135363338623438613138302c6368696c64426c6f636b4e756d6265723a37333837353732372c6368696c644f7261636c653a616336303335336135343837336334343631303132313638323961366139386364626263336633642c6368696c645265717565737465723a656533616665333437643563373433313730343165323631386334393533346461663838376332342c6368696c64436861696e49643a313337",

**Merge needs to occur imperatively before 11:00AM UTC**, otherwise the voting bot won't have any answer to commit for the pool, which means we will need to manually force push some answers & relaunch the bot manually. Ideally, this scenario should never happen. ðŸ™‚
